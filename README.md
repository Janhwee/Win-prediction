# Win-prediction
This project focuses on predicting the outcome of matches (e.g., sports games, esports tournaments, etc.) using a dataset containing historical match data. By analyzing past performances, player/team statistics, and other relevant features, the machine learning model aims to forecast the probability of a win, loss, or draw.
